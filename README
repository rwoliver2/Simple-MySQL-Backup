BACKGROUND

This script is a simple script to automate MySQL backups.  Its
main advantage is that you can backup multiple databases in individual
files instead of as all one file as the mysqldump -A command does,
without having to manually list each database in your backup script.

Each backup is stored in the location you specify in the mysql-backup.yml
file, stored in /etc.  This file also contains the root username and
password for MySQL.

LIMITATIONS

This script is not for backing up massively large databases, because
mysqldump won't do that well.  If you have a database that is quite large
or very, very busy, I would recommend other backup means.

INSTALLATION

Before proceeding with installation, you must first create a .my.cnf file
for the user that will be running this script (root recommended).  To do
this, run (replace vim with nano if you aren't familiar with vim):

vim ~/.my.cnf

In it, you should have:

[client]
user = root
password = mysqlrootpw

Put in your MySQL root access credentials.  If you don't have a password
for the MySQL root user, you can skip this.

Make sure the file is secure from prying eyes by running:

chmod 0600 ~/.my.cnf

Now, copy the included mysql-backup.yml sample file to /etc/mysql-backup.yml
and edit it to include the MySQL credentials as well.  You will also want
to change the path of the MySQL backup location.

Secure it afterwords by running:

chmod 0600 /etc/mysql-backup.yml

Once done, copy mysql-backup to /usr/local/bin and make it executable:

cp mysql-backup /usr/local/bin
chmod 0700 /usr/local/bin/mysql-backup

Only root will be able to run this, but this is preferable.  Adjust permissions
as necessary if you wish for another user to run it.

To run it, just run:

mysql-backup

and it should proceed without error.

If you get an error about a missing MySQL gem, then run:

gem install mysql
